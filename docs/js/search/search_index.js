authorization based on relationship roles.\nDocumentation\nRead more at https://emir-gradient.github.io/relationship-roles/.\nInstall\nnpm install relationship-rolesUsage\n\nDefine type for required relationship roles (enum, string, interface, etc.)\nCreate needed relationship resolvers by implementing RelationshipResolver\ninterface:\n\n/**\n * User - Type of user\n * RelatedObject - Type of related object (object user is related to)\n * RelationshipRole - Type of relationship role\n */\nexport interface RelationshipResolver {\n  /**\n   * Return Relationship Roles that this resolver is responsible to recognize.\n   */\n  getSupportedRelationships(): Promise;\n\n  /**\n   * Determine and provide relationship between user and related object.\n   */\n  getRelations(user: User, relatedObject: RelatedObject): Promise;\n}\nInstantiate and use authorization service:\n\nconst authorizationService = await getAuthorizationService([\n  ...resolvers // Resolvers created in step 2\n]);\n\n // Authorize 'user' related to 'relatedObject' based on 'requiredRoles'\n const result = await authorizationService.authorize(user, relatedObject, [...requiredRoles]);\n\n result; // true | falseExample\nSuppose that business requirement is to handle authorization for online store.\nAuthorization should be executed based on next relationships:\n\nStore Owner (the User owns the Store)\nStore Team Member (the User is member of the Store team)\nProduct Seller (the User sold the Product)\nProduct Buyer (the User bought the Product)\n\nRelevant entities that describe these scenarios are:\ninterface StoreEntity {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  owner: UserEntity;\n  team: UserEntity[];\n  products: ProductEntity[];\n}\n\ninterface ProductEntity {\n  id: string;\n  seller: UserEntity;\n  title: string;\n  price: number;\n  currency: string;\n  buyers: UserEntity[];\n}\n\ninterface UserEntity {\n  id: number;\n  fullName: string;\n  email: string;\n}Implementation Steps\n1. Define relationship roles needed for your project:\nenum StoreRole {\n  \"PRODUCT_SELLER\" = \"PRODUCT_SELLER\",\n  \"PRODUCT_BUYER\" = \"PRODUCT_BUYER\",\n  \"STORE_OWNER\" = \"STORE_OWNER\",\n  \"STORE_TEAM_MEMBER\" = \"STORE_TEAM_MEMBER\"\n}2. Implement StoreRelationshipResolver:\nclass StoreRelationshipResolver implements RelationshipResolver {\n  async getRelations(user: UserEntity, store: StoreEntity): Promise {\n    const relations: StoreRole[] = [];\n\n    if (store.owner.id === user.id) {\n      relations.push(StoreRole.STORE_OWNER);\n    }\n\n    if (store.team.find(t => t.id === user.id)) {\n      relations.push(StoreRole.STORE_TEAM_MEMBER);\n    }\n\n    return relations;\n  }\n\n  async getSupportedRelationships(): Promise {\n    return [StoreRole.STORE_OWNER, StoreRole.STORE_TEAM_MEMBER];\n  }\n}3. Implement ProductRelationshipResolver:\nclass ProductRelationshipResolver implements RelationshipResolver {\n\n  async getRelations(user: UserEntity, product: ProductEntity): Promise {\n    const relations: StoreRole[] = [];\n\n    if (product.seller.id === user.id) {\n      relations.push(StoreRole.PRODUCT_SELLER);\n    } else if (product.buyers.find(pb => pb.id === user.id)) {\n      relations.push(StoreRole.PRODUCT_BUYER);\n    }\n\n    return relations;\n  }\n\n  async getSupportedRelationships(): Promise {\n    return [StoreRole.PRODUCT_BUYER, StoreRole.PRODUCT_SELLER];\n  }\n}4. Authorize:\n const authorizationService = await getAuthorizationService([\n   new ProductRelationshipResolver(),\n   new StoreRelationshipResolver()\n ]);\n\n await authorizationService.authorize(user, store, [\n   StoreRole.STORE_OWNER,\n   StoreRole.STORE_TEAM_MEMBER\n ]); // true | false\n\n await authorizationService.authorize(user, product, [\n   StoreRole.PRODUCT_BUYER\n ]); // true | false\n\n await authorizationService.authorize(user, product, [\n   StoreRole.PRODUCT_SELLER\n ]); // true | falseTests\nnpm run testBuild\nnpm run buildCredits\nGradient Software Development https://gradient.ba\ninfo@gradient.ba\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 Gradient Software Development info@gradient.ba\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
